GatroNet presents an automated system for classifying gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), aimed at improving the accuracy and speed of diagnostic processes. GI disorders, such as polyps, ulcers, and tumors, pose substantial health risks if not detected early, with diagnosis often relying on manual analysis of endoscopy and colonoscopy images by specialists. Traditional diagnostic methods and existing deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), offer some assistance in image analysis but face notable limitations. CNNs, while effective for detecting localized features, struggle to capture the spatial relationships across different regions of an image, which are essential for identifying complex GI abnormalities. The proposed approach applies GNNs, which are particularly effective for analyzing data represented in graph structures, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of spatial patterns within medical images. Using a pre-existing dataset containing extracted features, the system constructs graph representations that GNNs can process to assess spatial connections across the image. This approach captures both local and global information, enhancing classification accuracy. GastroNet is designed to enhance diagnostic support for healthcare providers by improving accuracy and efficiency in identifying gastrointestinal abnormalities. Automated classification aims to reduce diagnostic delays and lessen the workload on medical professionals, particularly in resource-limited settings. With flexibility for integration into healthcare systems, GastroNet can facilitate timely and accurate diagnoses, ultimately benefiting patient outcomes. The modelâ€™s capability to process various imaging data types broadens its potential applications in medical diagnostics, contributing to more comprehensive and accessible healthcare solutions.
